# Bike Sales Dashboard – Power BI

This project presents a dynamic **Power BI** dashboard that explores used bike sales data across India. It provides valuable insights into **fuel efficiency, resale trends, depreciation, and regional variations**, empowering consumers, dealers, and analysts to make smarter decisions.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Cleanse, structure, and model raw bike sales datasets  
- Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for in-depth analysis  
- Design custom metrics such as **Resale Value Index** and **Efficiency Rating**  
- Highlight key trends based on brand, model, geography, and ownership type  

## 🧑‍💻 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** for dashboard creation  
- **Power Query Editor** for data transformation  
- **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated fields  
- Source data in **Excel/CSV** format  

## 📌 Dashboard Highlights

- 🔍 Filter options for brand and model with drill-down capabilities  
- 📊 Visualizations for price depreciation, mileage, and fuel efficiency  
- 🎯 Custom gauges for efficiency and resale scoring  
- 🗺️ Regional insights mapped across Indian states  
- 📌 KPI indicators for key performance metrics  

## 📁 Dataset Summary

Data attributes include:
- Brand & Model Name  
- Engine Displacement (CC)  
- Mileage and Pricing (New vs. Resale)  
- Manufacturing Year  
- Fuel and Ownership Types  
- Insurance status and Location  

🔹 **Source**: CSV file with around 2,900 entries  
🔹 **Coverage**: Second-hand bikes listed from multiple Indian regions  

## 📐 Calculated Metrics

- `Efficiency Rating = Mileage ÷ Engine Capacity`  
- `Depreciation Amount = Original Price - Resale Price`  
- `Resale Value Index = Resale Price ÷ Original Price`  
- Brand-, model-, and region-wise averages
